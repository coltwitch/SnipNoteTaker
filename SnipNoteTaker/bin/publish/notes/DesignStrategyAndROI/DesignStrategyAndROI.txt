Design is an investment
Most people in software industry has a fundamental misunderstanding and views design as a raw cost
Design makes and saves money
3 Major tangible measurable savings
 - user productivity
 - fewer errors
 - less training
Intangible benefits
 - customer satisfaction
 - employee satisfaction
Advanced cases: "game changing" innovation

The industry has a shortage of design expertise
More commonly, this design isn't done because there is a disconnect between
the way the team thinks and the way the decision makers think

First level of disconnect: decision makers don't understand what designers do
They think development is already too expensive.
The last thing they want is to spend more money on it
Common side effect: they discourage talking to users


"Design" as a term is overloaded
Getting past these obstacles
 - Tangible returns helps convince many of them
 - clarifying "what design is" will clear up many others

Match level of design effort to importance of the application
Level 1) Apply aesthetic design
Level 2) Apply isolated standalone design (data visualization, process flow, etc)
Level 3) Apply interaction design
 - Navigation of application is a big deal here
Level 4) Apply design thinking across entire workflows

How to start - Gradual approach

Take an isolated piece and do a simple process
