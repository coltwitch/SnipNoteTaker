C# Misunderstandings

A console application no longer needs a Program class
You can now use async in Main()
using static System.Console;
Console.WriteLine("Hello world.");
^ that's a whole valid file. For... whatever reason
This is called "Static directives"
C# is starting to implement very javascript style files
Default literals
You must use the question mark in order to mark as nullable for a nullable reference type
when #nullable enable
C# is headed in the direction that null reference exception is not hit in runtime
#nullable disable
^turns it off
Targeted type expression
Please, if you must do line 16, use named parameters:
Null check built in
Tuple matching:
init keyword
You can get it whenever, but you can only set it when initializing the item
You can set it once, but never again
So you can set it outside of the constructor as long as it has not already been assigned

Automatic IComparable
With keyword
New way using yield:
This allows for the individual records to be foreach'ed without loading them into memory simultaneously
IAsyncEnumerable
Concurrent parallel tasks
